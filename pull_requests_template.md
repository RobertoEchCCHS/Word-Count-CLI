Project Details
	1.	What is the name of your project?
Word Count CLI
	2.	How many hours did you spend developing this?
I spent approximately 7 hours developing this tool. Unfortunately, my Wakatime tracker was blocked by parental controls, so I couldn’t use it to track the exact time spent.
	3.	Briefly describe what your project is. What makes it unique?
The Word Count CLI is a Python-based tool that allows users to quickly count the number of words in .txt files within their project folder via the command line. The unique feature is that it provides a simple solution for platforms that don’t have a built-in word count feature. This tool is specifically designed to be a quick and easy workaround for students or anyone needing a word count function in environments that don’t support it.
	4.	How many people have tested your extension?
This project has been tested by at least 10 people, including myself.
	5.	On What operating systems have you tested this project?
I have tested the project on Windows and Linux.
	6.	Does your project include a Readme file with instructions on how to use it?
Yes.



Additional Comments

I’ve put a lot of thought into making this tool simple and easy to use. It should be particularly helpful for students in my school’s platform, which doesn’t have a word count feature. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to let me know!
